# Quartz (old prototype)
An old prototype version of the Quartz template engine, made in Python.

Quartz is a templating engine built in Python, that generates HTML files as output.

⚠️This project is extremely unpolished, and may not work as expected, and I won't support it.⚠️

The new version of Quartz, which I'll now be working on: https://github.com/half-real-SCRACX/quartz (link isn't working yet, as I haven't published the repo).
