# Quartz (old prototype)

An old prototype of an HTML templating engine, made in Python. It's just an experiment, not a project I'll be working on.

***

Quartz is a web templating engine built in Python, that generates HTML files as output.

⚠️ This project is extremely unpolished, I worked on it only a few hours. I don't even recommend forking, if you want to work on something like this, do it from scratch :)
